- About Page

Hi, I'm Kenneth! I'm currently a student at Indian River State College, and this site serves mostly as a portfolio of the work I've created and skills I've developed during my time there.
If you really enjoy my art, there's a page where you can commission me for a piece of your own!
You can also browse my shop page, which has links to books I've illustrated, as well as a link to my sticker store.
